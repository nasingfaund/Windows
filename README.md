### Disclaimer: PAUSED PROJECT, EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS DO NOT USE IF YOU USE WINDOWS OTHER THAN EDITING AND RECORDING AND OR GAMING. IF NOT DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!
# Let me describe why I am closing this project for a while.
### Sorry but I have temperately paused this project as it has been slowing down other projects I am working on in the meantime. I feel constantly stressed to improve it but not a lot of improvements have came when you aren't being so careful anymore. So I have had a few crashes lately due to these large edits but I have not experimented on jet and probably won’t ever as I don’t understand what to do most of the time. In the future I’m willing to change that and invest more time but at the moment I cannot hold the pressure anymore. To be honest I just don't care about ruining my experience I just hope that this doesn't hurt your games or waste time for you. But I've learned so much over the past 5 years or so of using Windows (7, 10, 11), I have used it since I was born basically! I know pretty much everything when it comes to fixing problems that grandma has issues with and etc but not when it comes to programming or advance script. That’s too complicated and mind blowing for me I just feel stupid when doing large project but I love the excitement and challenge but sometimes our minds just can’t handle it in the long term. But in that note hopefully I will give out all the scripts and command I've gathered from the Internet and myself edits. I thought that this would be a lot easier but I wanted more than just copying so I edited somethings and found the better parameters to use with. Anyone could do this but who has the time? *Sign* What could help this be completed sooner? A lot more research and more testing but I want to warn anyone who is downloading this that it might and probably will hurt your standard user if you love Windows features and how many apps it will give you this might be a complete turn off. In other words it removes about 60% of the apps and install nothing to replace them, that’s your job to find a great alternative to. I have a lot of them so I will make a list just in case you want to see what I use and prefer to Windows. Click here. But for those who are mostly playing and editing videos this is ideal for performance and privacy. It will have a lot of conflicts! I have experienced a lot of issues with Discord screen-sharing when injecting into Rainbow Six Siege and with blue screen and even crashes somewhat ordinary Kdenlive and many other applications (except low priority apps so I think it’s something to do with the CPU reg edits Prob easy fix we’ll see.) but this is due to editing the Registry Editor but I want you to know this before hand. You should see more Disclaimers now. Thank you once again for taking your precious time, let this project live on and fix its issues in time. Until I figure which are causing issues it won't be usable for the most part unless you want to be running experimental settings... Good bye for now!


Before you read what this does, I'd suggest reading below for best practices on Windows.
1. Sign in & out of Microsoft Store.
2. Running script provided in the download or run them by looking at our tutorials that takes under 10 minutes to finish.

# MSWindows-RE
Never listen to Microsoft telemetries and false entries that don't work better in way normally it wouldn't. I hope its more reliable with this cleanup script to remove most or at least some of the items on your machine that are just temporary and aren't really necessary for processes.

Disclaimer: This proprietory will surely permanently uninstall some apps by Microsoft or Partners of Windows.
I must suggest you use # to exclude any script in PowerShell and Command Prompt files.

  The reason I decided to add the most used apps is that everyone uses other better-performing programs.

Quick and effective links to remove stuff... I found that Microsoft "helps" you remove Office with a downloadable file.
